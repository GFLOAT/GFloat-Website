  bio: Mr. Lander joined the Renaissance Computing Institute in April 2005 and has worked extensively here with the application of Cyber Science and Engineering to data intensive scientific disciplines including neuroscience, physical oceanography and evolutionary biology. In particular Mr. Lander was an active participant in both the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) Coastal Ocean Observing and Prediction Program (SCOOP) and North Carolina Flood Mapping (NCFMP) projects. Mr. Lander is currently a Co-PI on the NeuroBridge, a NIDA funded project whose goals are to increase the discoverability of relevant data in the neurosciences. From 2012 to 2015, Mr. Lander was a Co-PI on the DataBridge project, an NSF funded research effort investigating the use of sociometric techniques to produce a Facebook like social network for data sets from the long tail of science. From 2016 to 2017 Mr. Lander was a CO-PI on the DataBridge for NeuroScience project, an NSF funded follow-up to the DataBridge. As part of this project, Mr. Lander chaired the INCF 2018 Workshop on Advanced Data Discovery for Neuroscience which occurred at INCF's Neuroinformatics 2018 meeting.

  bio: "Dr. Bijsterbosch's research focuses on functional brain networks to investigate brain connectivity from three different angles: Firstly, Dr. Bijsterbosch uses population datasets such as the UK Biobank to study individual differences in brain connectivity and their potential to predict risk and resilience to mental health disorders such as depression. Secondly, Dr. Bijsterbosch works on methodological challenges in relation representing high-dimensional resting state functional MRI data into a lower dimensional set of features that are sensitive and interpretable. Thirdly, Dr. Bijsterbosch performs cross-scale research in collaboration with Dr. Larry Snyder to determine how large-scale networks observed with functional MRI behave at the level of individual neural cells."

  bio: "Dr. Lei Wang's lab research is focused on the development of multidimensional and multimodal neuroimaging biomarkers using the tools of computational anatomy. Working with collaborators from engineering, mathematics, psychology and clinical specialties, the team focuses on the following major areas: Mapping of Brain Structures using MRI. Dr. Wang develops automated pipelines to delineate brain structures based on simultaneous mappings of multiple structures from multiple atlases. This includes deep brain structures (such as the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and basal ganglia) and cortical structures.Complex Neuroimaging Biomarkers. They develop modeling and statistical approaches for the analysis of these maps and frameworks for joint, integrated analyses of multidimensional, multimodal information based on the structural mapping of the brain."
